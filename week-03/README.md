## Week 3 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 3 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-3" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 3 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-3 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 2]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Why is it useful to clear the Log window prior to resubmitting a corrected program?



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 3]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): What are some ways to avoid unbalanced quotation marks?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): Paying attention to the color-coding of the text when programming in SAS is helpful. Text in quotation marks usually appear purple.


 
[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 4]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): How can you determine the precise location of where the syntax error occurred?



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 5]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): If it is not evident where errors were committed, how can you diagnose the problem?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): The "Help" menu offers additional links and resources for online help.



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 6]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Why do some programming errors result in ERRORS while others in WARNINGS?



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 7]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): What are other common syntax errors that SAS can successfully interpret and return warnings rather than erros?



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 10]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): How can you gauge program processing time?



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 1]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Is there a limit to the restrictions you can add to the "where" clause?



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 3]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Is it necessary to include commas to delimit items listed in the "in" operator?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): No, SAS can process this if the list is delimited by spaces.



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 4]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): What is the default sort order? 
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): Unless specified, SAS sorts data in ascending order by the variable(s) called.



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 7]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Why does SAS continue to run a program even after if has encountered an error?



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 9]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): What is the most efficient way to add a lengthy list of character values into a conditional statement?



[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 10]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Is there a limit to report size in SAS?



[recipe_to_check_for_duplicates Week 3 Recipe]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): If you are expecting multiple rows per unique identifier, how can you remove duplicate rows from a data set? 



[recipe_for_sorting_data Week 3 Recipe]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): To sort a data set in descending order by all variables listed, can we simply put paratheses around the specified variables?



[recipe_for_printing_values Week 3 Recipe]
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Rather than viewing data sets in SAS, is it possible to export them to Excel or other tools?

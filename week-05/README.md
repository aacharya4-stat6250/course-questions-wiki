## Week 5 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 5 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-5" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 5 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-5 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

********************************************************************************



[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 1]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Since we are defining filerefs, why is the command Filename instead of fileref?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How to associate a fileref to multiple external files? How to access specific files from a directory?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): The FILENAME can associate a fileref to a directory that contains multiple files. A specific file from the directory can then be referenced using the fileref followed by the individual filename in paranthesis.



[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 2]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Can filrefs be removed without your permission?
- *Answer* (jcanfield3-stat6250): No since they can only be manually changed or when SAS is closed.
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): What is the scope of files referenced by FILENAME statement?



[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 6]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Could all three solutions potentially work?
- *Answer* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Yes, if you add labels to the variables to match the given output.
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How should the character and numeric data fields from raw file be defined in SAS dataset?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): While specifying character fields, the variable name should be followed by '$' sign.



[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 7]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Could you input different variables using overlapping columns?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Should all the colums from a raw file be read into SAS dataset ? Can the fields from raw file be read in any order ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 5, Problem 8]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): If income isn't predefined, what is the resulting output of income=income*2?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How to redefine a variable with a new value using SAS expressions?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 1]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Is there a way to print the values of _N_ and _Error_?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): While subsetting data, are the observations filtered during compilation phase ?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 2]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Which syntax errors halt the execution of the compilation phase?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): If SAS can interpret a syntax error, will the program DATA step still compile?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): If SAS can interpret a syntax error, then the DATA step compiles and executes. If SAS cannot interpret a syntax error, then the DATA step compiles but does not execute.



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 3]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Is there a memory cap for the amount of records that can be inputed?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Will the DATA step execute for each observation?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 4]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Can a missing value be considered undefined?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How does _N_ and _ERROR_ values loop for each record in the file?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 5]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Why can _Error_ only take values 0 or 1? Wouldn't knowing the amount of errors be more useful?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Is the program data vector values initialized before every record read or will the input data be stored as an array in the program data vector?



[Course Textbook Chapter 6, Problem 6]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Is the descriptor portion also reset along with the values?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): After the iterative read by DATA statement, what happens to the program data vector during and after execution phase?



[basic_recipe_for_creating_analytic_datasets Week 5 Recipe]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Does the order matter for the keep, retain, and set functions?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Why does SAS read a DATA step twice for compilation and execution?



[adv_recipe_for_creating_analytic_datasets Week 5 Recipe]
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): What are some other uses of proc sql?
- *Answer* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Proq Sql can be used to "retrieve and manipulate data that is stored in tables or views; create tables, views, and indexes on columns in tables; create SAS macro variables that contain values from rows in a query's result; add or modify the data values in a tableâ€™s columns or insert and delete rows. You can also modify the table itself by adding, modifying, or dropping columns; and send DBMS-specific SQL statements to a database management system (DBMS) and retrieve DBMS data". 
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): What is the function of PROC SQL statement? Can larger datasets be processed with PROC SQL ?

## Week 9 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 9 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-9" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 9 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-9 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 1]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Is there any special occasion where the Do loop can be used in the PROC step?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 2]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Can the DO loop be consider similar to a FOR loop in R?
- Answer (who7-stat6250): It is very similar.  The way it goes through their iteration are very similar.



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 3]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Does the increment in the DO loop have a minimum?
- Answer (who7-stat6250): The default increment is 1 unless otherise specified.



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 4]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Can we set arbituary variable for the count in a DO loop?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 5]
- Question (who7−stat6250): What will happen if we did not include end after the DO loop?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 6]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Can we set output equal to new dataset name like when we create new dataset from before?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 7]
- Question (who7−stat6250): What are the main difference between DO WHILE and a DO UNTIL loop?
- Answer (who7-stat6250): DO WHILE loop can skil over some observation while DO UNTIL will go through each observation.



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 8]
- Question (who7−stat6250): In what scenerio would the DO UNTIL loop does not execute the enclosed statement at all.



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 9]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Would the variable need to be sorted before we can use DO UNTIL loop?

- Question (who7−stat6250): Can we use DO WHILE or DO UNTIL for the array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 4]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Is there a way to write a shorter code if we want to include all months besides listing all of them in the array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 5]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Can we create a two-dimensional array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 6]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Why was the length of character variable set at 8?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 7]
- Question (who7−stat6250): How do we rotate the dataset if we have a 3D dataset like an olap cube?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 8]
- Question (who7−stat6250): Can we achieve the same effect to creating temporary values by creating an new varaible in the dataset?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 9]
- Question (who7−stat6250): What would happen if we select something out of the array?



[recipe_to_create_unique_record_id Week 9 Recipe]
- Question (who7−stat6250): What are other format beside z6?



[recipe_to_disaggregate_counts_data Week 9 Recipe]
- Question (who7−stat6250): How is the second example different from the first example besides removing all missing value?

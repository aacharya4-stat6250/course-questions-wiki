## Week 9 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 9 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-9" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 9 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-9 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): When a DO loop is executed, what does the DATA step do?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 5]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): Why does an OUTPUT statement need to be placed inside a DO loop?

[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 8]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): During what part of the loop is the DO UNTIL statemnet evaluated, and what happens if the expression is evaluated as false?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 9]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): During what part of the loop is the DO WHILE statemnet evaluated, and what happens if the expression is evaluated as true?



[Course Textbook Chapter 14, Problem 10]

- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What is the purpose of the specification of the dimension of the array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 3]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): When are arrays used with a DO loop?
- *Answer* (shatcher4-stat6250): Arrays are generally used with DO loops to process multiple variables and to perform repetitive calculations.



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 4]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): How do you specify the elements of an array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 5]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What is the purpose of the i in the DO loop of an array?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 6]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250):  If exisiting variables within an array are not referenced, why does SAS automatically create new variables and assigns them default names?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 7]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): How do you create an array of character variables?



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 8]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What is the purpose of temporary array elements?
- *Answer* (shatcher4-stat6250): Temporary array elements are useful when the array is needed for calculations, since these temporary arrays can improve performance time.



[Course Textbook Chapter 15, Problem 9]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): How do assign inital values in an ARRAY statement?What is the purpose of temporary array elements
